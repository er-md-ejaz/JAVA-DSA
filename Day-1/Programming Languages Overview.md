**What is a Programming Language?**

Just like we use languages (like English or Hindi) to talk to people, programmers use programming languages to talk to computers. A programming language is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do.

**Main Types of Programming Languages**

*1. Machine Language*

The lowest-level language, made of only 0s and 1s.

The computer understands it directly.

No translator is needed.

*2. Assembly Language*

Still low-level, but more human-friendly than machine language.

Uses short words (like MOV, ADD) to represent instructions.

Needs a tool called an assembler to turn it into machine language.

Works closely with the hardware.

*3. High-Level Language*

Easy for humans to read and write.

Looks more like regular language (e.g., print("Hello")).

Needs a compiler or interpreter to convert it into machine code.

Examples: Python, Java, C++

**Other Classifications of Programming Languages**

*A. Procedural Language*

Solves problems step-by-step.

Breaks the program into small reusable blocks called functions or procedures.

Good for writing structured code.

Examples: C, FORTRAN

*B. Functional Language*

Solves problems using pure functions, like in math.

Avoids changing data or using loops.

Focuses on what to do, not how to do it.

Examples: Haskell, Python (partially)

*C. Object-Oriented Language*

Works using objects, which are bundles of data and functions.

Helps keep code organized and reusable.

Encourages thinking in terms of real-world things.

Example: Java

*D. Scripting Language*

Runs one command at a time.

Usually doesn't need to be compiled.

Quick and easy to write.

Examples: Python, JavaScript

*E. Statically Typed Language*

You must tell the computer the type of data (like int, string) before using it.

Checks for errors during compilation.

Example: Java, C

*F. Dynamically Typed Language*

You don’t have to specify data types.

The language figures it out while the program is running.

Example: Python, JavaScript

**Memory Management in Java**

In Java, the system takes care of memory by itself. It creates and removes objects when needed using a feature called the Garbage Collector.

*Stack vs Heap Memory:*

Stack Memory: Stores variables and function calls. It’s fast and small.

Heap Memory: Stores objects and large data. It’s bigger and used across the program.
