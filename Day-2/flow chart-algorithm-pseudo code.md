# What is a flowchart?
It is a diagram that represents a workflow or process. It is nothing but a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.

# What are components of a flowchart? 
It shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.

1. Oval - It marks the Start/End of the flow.

2. Arrow - Connector which shows the flow of relationship between various symbols.

3. Parallelogram - It represents input and output.

4. Rectangle - It represents a process.

5. Diamond - It is used in decision formation.

# Process?

A process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed.

# What is an Algorithm? 

An algorithm is a procedure or set of rules that defines how a program is to be executed. In the algorithm, plain text is used. The algorithm does not follow any rules

# What is a Pseudocode? 
Pseudocode is an informal, code-like representation of an algorithm. It mimics the structure of actual programming code but is written in plain English to describe the logic clearly without adhering to any programming language syntax.

# Example of Pseudocode

1. Initialize a result = [  ]

2. Initialize a class = 1

3. Initialize a section = 'A'

4. While class is less than 13

5. Initialize a name, marks = [  ]

6. while section is less than 'D'

7. get name and marks of topper.

8. go to next section.

9. store topper of 3 sections into result.

10. go to next class.

11. Find the topper from the result.
